# 📘 Python Assignment – Data Structures & Strings

This program demonstrates the use of dictionaries and list slicing in Python through two practical tasks.

---

## 🧮 Task 1: Dictionary of Student Marks
- A dictionary stores student names as **keys** and their marks as **values**.
- The user enters a student's name.
- The program displays the corresponding marks if the name exists.
- If the student is not found, an appropriate message is shown.

---

## 🔢 Task 2: List Slicing Demonstration
- Creates a list of numbers from **1 to 10**.
- Extracts the **first five elements** using slicing.
- Reverses the extracted elements using slicing.
- Prints the original list, extracted list, and reversed elements.

---

## 🎯 Concepts Practiced
- Dictionary operations and `.get()` method
- Handling missing keys
- List slicing (`[:5]`, `[::-1]`)
- Basic input/output with print and user input
